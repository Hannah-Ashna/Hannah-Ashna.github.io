              I see you’ve navigated to my little about me page so I guess it’s time for an introduction!
              My name is Hannah Ashna, I’m an international student from Malaysia and I’m currently about to start my second year at Nottingham Trent University (NTU).  
              I’m a gamer at heart, hence why I’m currently working on a Computer Science (Games Technology) degree here at NTU
              <br>Most of my social media handles do a pretty good job of expressing who I am but if you’re a little lazy (I totally get it), I can summarise a few things for you.
              <br>I spent a little bit of my childhood in a small town an hour away from Kuala Lumpur. At the age of twelve, I moved to Dubai, U.A.E. to live with my mom. My time in Dubai was filled with all kinds of adventures and here are a few of them:
              <br><br>
            </p>
            <ul class = " lead ParagraphStyle">
              <li>In 2015 I was placed in the Top-Five Debaters from the Middle East Category at a Debating competition.</li>
              <li>Participated and worked in the committee for several Model United Nations (MUN) events.</li>
              <li>I became a public speaker and mental health advocate. </li>
              <li>I helped co-direct and stage manage several productions for my high school’s Performing Arts department.</li>
            </ul>

                  After I completed my international GCSEs I moved back to Malaysia to work on my A-levels at Methodist College Kuala Lumpur (MCKL) since I received a scholarship to study there. 
                  At the end of my time at MCKL, I received the ‘Outstanding Scholar’ award for my A-levels performance.
                  Then came NTU and now here we are …  beginning a whole new chapter in my little journey.
                  <br><br>Outside of academics, I’ve got a few interests and hobbies to keep me busy. I have been a returning volunteer at the Logisym conference since 2017 and am now an Instructor for Code First Girls student-taught courses/programs. I am also a committee member for NTU’s BCS chapter, DevSoc (Developer’s Society). I’m also a huge theatre nerd and dungeons and dragons fan. Whenever I get the time I’m probably out looking for a show to catch or a game to play with friends. I have a separate page for my D&D campaigns/characters if you’re interested in that stuff.

              <br>Aside from all of that, some of my current tech-related interests include cybersecurity and pen-testing at the moment. Over the duration of the lockdown in the UK I decided to invest some time into learning more about it and now I ‘casually compete’ with friends on HackTheBox (HTB) and TryHackMe (THM). I’m in no way a professional or expert, just a curious ‘script kiddie’. Do feel free to get in touch with me about it though if you’d like to get involved.
              <br><br>It seems like that’s about it for now. In case you’re looking to check out some of my projects or experiences, I have detailed most of them on this site and if that still isn’t enough you can always hit me up via any of my social media which I’ve linked below.
