              Hey there! Welcome to my little blog. I’ve decided to use this platform as a way to detail all my CPD (Continuing Professional Development) adventures. For my CPD hours in term one, I decided to explore two primary areas: My future career and my personal life/hobbies.
              <br><br>With regards to my career, I looked into attending several fairs held by NTU alongside joining both their Acceler8 Award programme and Acceler8 Global Award programme. They’ve been immensely helpful in preparing me for not only my placement year but also my future job hunt post-graduation in 2023. 
              <br><br>When it came to my personal life and hobbies I decided to finally start playing Dungeons and Dragons, a game I’ve always been curious about. I also joined the Developers Society (DevSoc) and attended the HackNotts event. I had never tried to hack before but that quickly changed thanks to the coaches at the event, and now I have a new skill added to my arsenal.
              <br><br>Each page dives into a particular experience I chose to partake in. They include pictures, recounts of some adventures and a summary of what I learnt at the end of it.
              <br><br>Feel free to get in touch if you’re curious about any particular experiences. I’ve linked a few of my social media handles at the bottom of this page that’ll help you navigate your way to them. In addition to that, if you’re curious who I am, there is an about me page that talks a little bit who I am, where I’m from and what my interests are … you know, standard stuff.
              <br><br>Well, guess that’s about it for now. Have fun exploring!
